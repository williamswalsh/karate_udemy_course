# karate_udemy_course
My tests created during "Karate DSL: API Automation and Performance from Zero to Hero" course.

# Project Structure
- angular-real-world-app - this will be ran locally to run karate tests against - this doesn't change.
- karate-template - this is the collection of integration tests to test angular-real-world-app.
- karate-todo - this most likely can be removed.
